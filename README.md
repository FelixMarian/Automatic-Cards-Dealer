# Automatic-Cards-Dealer
This is an automatic card dealer. You can set up to 5 players, with each receiving up to 5 cards, and you also have the option to set the position of each player. This project was done on an ATMega328P, as close to bare metal as possible, without any high-level libraries and functions
